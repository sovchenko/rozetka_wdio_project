## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Following tools should be installed on the local machine:
- Docker and Docker Compose ([link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) to the installation guide)
- Node.js and npm ([link](https://nodejs.org/uk/download/package-manager/) to the installation guide)
- Make ([link](https://linuxhint.com/install-make-ubuntu/) to the installation guide)

### Installing

1. Clone the project to your local machine

2. Install all the required dependencies by running the following command (should be run from the project dir):

```
npm i
```

3. To build docker image for the project run the following command (docker daemon should be started and running):

```
